## About
This project is part of a short demo I put together for a training meeting in order to pitch the benefits of integrating AR into the edge node cluster deployment curriculum we teach.

Representing 3 dimensions on a 2 dimensional medium is hard. AR helps solve this in a few ways:
[1] Allows content creators to work in multiple dimensions.
[2] Provides users with a structured, interactive hands-on learning experience.
[3] By utilizing markers, each step builds upon the previous. Allowing users to control the rate/flow of information uptake.
[4] It is engaging, but not distracting.

There were plans to overlay instructional text on the models, but the idea never made it out of the board room. Feel free to use the model for one of your projects!
